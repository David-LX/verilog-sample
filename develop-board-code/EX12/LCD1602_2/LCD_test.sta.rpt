Info: Running Quartus II TimeQuest Timing Analyzer
    Info: Version 7.2 Build 151 09/26/2007 SJ Full Version
    Info: Processing started: Wed Nov 16 12:14:24 2011
Info: Command: quartus_sta LCD_test -c LCD_test
Info: qsta_default_script.tcl version: 25.0.1.4
Warning: Found USE_TIMEQUEST_TIMING_ANALYZER=OFF. The TimeQuest Timing Analyzer is not the default Timing Analysis Tool during full compilation.
Critical Warning: SDC file not found: 'LCD_test.sdc'. An SDC file is required by the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the compiler will not properly optimize the design
Info: No user constrained base clocks found in the design. Calling "derive_clocks -period 1.0"
Warning: No clocks defined in design.
Warning: Command report_clocks could not find any constraints or exceptions to report
Warning: Command report_clock_fmax_summary could not find any constraints or exceptions to report
Info: No setup paths to report
Info: No hold paths to report
Info: No recovery paths to report
Info: No removal paths to report
Warning: Command report_min_pulse_width could not find any constraints or exceptions to report
Warning: Advanced I/O Timing is not enabled
Info: Design is not fully constrained for setup requirements
Info: Design is not fully constrained for hold requirements
Info: Quartus II TimeQuest Timing Analyzer was successful. 0 errors, 7 warnings
    Info: Allocated 111 megabytes of memory during processing
