    Info: Processing started: Sun Nov 06 22:08:09 2011
Info: Command: quartus_fit --read_settings_files=off --write_settings_files=off IrDA -c IrDA
Info: Selected device EPM240T100C5 for design "IrDA"
Warning: The high junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '85'.
Warning: The low junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '0'.
Info: Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Info: Device migration not selected. If you intend to use device migration later, you may need to change the pin assignments as they may be incompatible with other devices
    Info: Device EPM240T100I5 is compatible
    Info: Device EPM570T100C5 is compatible
    Info: Device EPM570T100I5 is compatible
Info: Fitter is using the Classic Timing Analyzer
Info: Timing requirements not specified -- optimizing circuit to achieve the following default global requirements
    Info: Assuming a global fmax requirement of 1000 MHz
    Info: Assuming a global tsu requirement of 2.0 ns
    Info: Assuming a global tco requirement of 1.0 ns
    Info: Assuming a global tpd requirement of 1.0 ns
Info: Completed User Assigned Global Signals Promotion Operation
Info: Automatically promoted signal "clk" to use Global clock
Info: Pin "clk" drives global clock, but is not placed in a dedicated clock pin position
Info: Automatically promoted some destinations of signal "rst_n" to use Global clock
    Info: Destination "irda_check:inst1|irda_data[4]" may be non-global or may not use global clock
    Info: Destination "irda_check:inst1|irda_data[8]" may be non-global or may not use global clock
